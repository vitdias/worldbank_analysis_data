# <strong> Evolution of internet in Argentina
This analysis explores the growth and current status of internet usage in Argentina. The data was compiled using Jupyter notebooks, specifically the *exploration.ipynb*, to interact with the World Bank API and perform web scraping from various websites.

## Files and Folders
* *Tableau Sources*: Contains all the sources used to build the Tableau dashboard.
* *Downloaded Files*: Includes CSV files manually downloaded due to network errors with the World Bank API, which was unstable during the data gathering phase.
* Assets: This folder houses images used in the dashboard, Excel files for exploring and selecting indicators, and an XML mockup file created on [draw.io](https://drawn.io).

## Sources
* Worldbank API and website
* Web scraping from [Today Testing](https://todaytesting.com/internet-speed-vs-cost/), which provides an analysis using 2023 data from [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index) and [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/prices_by_country.jsp?displayCurrency=USD&itemId=33).

## Analysis and conclusion
The dashboard is hosted on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vitor.dias/viz/TableaubookARG/MainDashboard?publish=yes).

The objective was to first understand Argentina's demographic and economic context to better inform the subsequent analysis of internet usage trends. The first three charts depict Argentina's population, GDP per capita, and its rank in GDP per capita compared to other South American countries. Over the last 30 years, Argentina saw approximately a 50% increase in population and more than a threefold increase in GDP per capita. However, other South American countries have experienced higher GDP per capita growth.

In 2022, Argentina had the third-highest internet usage rate in South America, with 88% of the population using the internet, trailing only Uruguay and Chile. Despite widespread internet coverage, the speed of the internet in Argentina does not compare favorably with many other countries, though the cost of internet service is relatively low.

The disparity in internet access between the 40% poorest and the 60% richest in the population is minimal. The rate of growth in online purchases has outpaced the growth in the number of new internet users. Notably, in 2021, about 49% of the population made an online purchase, while 87% had used the internet at least once that year.

A strong correlation exists in countries where over 65% of the population uses the internet: as GDP per capita increases, so does the percentage of internet users.

## Conclusion
Argentina ranks among the top three countries in South America in terms of internet usage, with a notable increase in online shopping behaviors. The relatively low monthly cost of internet likely contributes to the high percentage of the population that uses the internet, despite its slower speeds compared to other countries. This scenario positions Argentina as a promising market for online commerce and internet-related startups.
